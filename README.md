## Who We Are
We are Rusty and Stretch, a passionate two-person indie game development team based in the North of Scotland.

Our small size allows us to focus on what truly matters: making games that are fun, engaging, and memorable.

## What We Do
At 942Games, our mission is simple: **create games that we love to play**. Whether itâ€™s an epic adventure or a quirky puzzle game, we pour our creativity and enthusiasm into every project. We're constantly experimenting with new ideas and mechanics, always pushing ourselves to deliver something special.
